The aim is to demonstrate Uniform Cost Search algorithm on a simple graph setting. The experiment provides a step-by-step understanding of the UCS algorithm, and how it can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Objectives
- **Understand the Uniform Cost Search algorithm and explore the cost functions:** Learn the working principles of Uniform Cost Search algorithm and the role of the cost function in guiding the search process.
- **Visualize the search process and path history**: Observe the step-by-step search process of Uniform Cost Search algorithm on a graph, highlighting the nodes expanded, the path taken, and path cost values for each node from the start node.
