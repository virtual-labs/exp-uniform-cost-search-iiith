      "explanations": {
        "a": "Nodes need to be expanded in order of their cost, so a stack is not suitable.",
        "b": "Nodes need to be expanded in order of their cost, so a linked list is not suitable.",
        "c": "Nodes are expanded in order of their cost (g values), so a priority queue is used to store the nodes.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "",

        "a": "When the goal node is generated.",

        "a": "This is incorrect as there could still be other paths to explore.",

      "question": "Consider a navigation system where UCS is used to find the shortest path between two locations. The graph representing the road network has varying edge costs corresponding to the distance between intersections. What advantage does UCS offer in this scenario compared to other search algorithms?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "UCS guarantees finding the shortest path regardless of edge costs.",
        "b": "UCS efficiently explores paths based on their cumulative costs, ensuring the shortest path is found first.",
        "c": "UCS always selects the path with the lowest number of steps, leading to shorter travel times.",
        "d": "UCS prioritizes paths with the lowest heuristic values, resulting in faster navigation."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "UCS requires edge costs to be non-negative.",
        "b": "UCS is designed to explore paths based on their cumulative costs, ensuring the shortest path is found first.",
        "c": "UCS prioritizes paths based on their cumulative costs, not the number of steps.",

        "a": "UCS is designed to handle varying edge costs efficiently by exploring paths based on their cumulative costs.",
        "b": "If all the edge costs are the same, then other algorithms like breadth first search perform better than uniform cost search. Check time and space complexity section in the theory section",
