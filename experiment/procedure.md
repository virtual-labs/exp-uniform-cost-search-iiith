## Step 1:
In the demo section, choose any of the three graphs to visualize the algorithm. In practice section, create a graph, or use the preset graph. Select the start vertex and end vertex.
- **Start Vertex:** Initial state for the beginning of the algorithm.
- **End Vertex:** Goal state, reaching which the algorithm will stop.
## Step 2:
Click on the Start UCS button to begin the experiment.
## Step 3:
View the central canvas and changes as you keep clicking the Next button. View the instructions section for details about the different controls. View the Information and Path History sections for details about the algorithm.
