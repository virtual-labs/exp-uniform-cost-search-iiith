      "question": "In this implementation of the algorithm, can there be multiple path cost values for the same node in the frontier?",

        "a": "yes",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "It is possible for the same node to be reached by multiple paths, each with a different path cost. Since we are not replacing nodes with lower path costs, but adding them to the frontier, there can be multiple path cost values for the same node.",
        "b": "Since we are not replacing nodes with lower path costs, but adding them to the frontier, there can be multiple path cost values for the same node."

      "question": "What happens if UCS does not keep track of visited nodes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It will always find the optimal solution",

        "c": "It will only explore nodes with the highest cost.",
        "d": "It will have a time complexity of O(b^d)."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Let two node A and B have the shortest edge cost. Then UCS will keep visiting A and B from each other and will not find the optimal solution.",
        "b": "Let two node A and B have the shortest edge cost. Then UCS will keep visiting A and B from each other and this will result in an infinite loop.",
        "c": "UCS will still explore based on lowest path cost.",
        "d": "Whether or not UCS keeps track of visited nodes doesn't directly determine its time complexity."
